# Why Use Expo

Expo is a powerful framework built on top of React Native that simplifies mobile app development. It provides tools and services that make it easy to build, test, and deploy cross-platform applications without dealing with complex native configurations. With features like **Expo Go** for instant testing, **pre-built APIs and components**, and **over-the-air updates**, developers can focus on building apps faster and more efficiently.

# Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have **Node.js (v16+)**, **VS Code**, and **Expo CLI** installed. Create your project with `npx create-expo-app MyApp`, then start it using `npx expo start`. Use the **Expo Go** app on your physical device to scan the QR code and view your app in real time. This stack—**React Native**, **TypeScript**, **NativeWindCSS**, and **Expo**—offers a modern, efficient, and cross-platform workflow for building high-quality mobile applications quickly and seamlessly.
